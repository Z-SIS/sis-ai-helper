    # Note: Deployment is handled directly by Vercel's Git integration (connect your GitHub repo
    # to Vercel in the Vercel dashboard). This keeps tokens and secrets in Vercel only and
    # avoids duplicating VERCEL_* secrets in GitHub. If you need to run vercel CLI from Actions,
    # add the required secrets to GitHub and re-enable the deploy step.
